# hello-world
first repository ever

I like python and c# , used python in ML(machine learning) and c# in game development
interested more in ai stuff like self driving car (ex:tesla) and comma.ai which provides
the latest technoligy for self driven cars.

  comma.ai is a device that's mounted instead the rear view mirror and has a camera that draws
  a map of the street in dots so i can learn the logic of driving simply by sampling alot of real
  life driving videos.
